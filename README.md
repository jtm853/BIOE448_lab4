This repository contains the code written on February 12, 2025 in the Microcontrollers lab of Dr. James Long. 

In that week's lab, we used the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor in conjunction with an Arduino Uno microcontroller to setup a device that displays the distance of objects from the sensor in real time.
We used a red LED to indicate when the sensor was brought within 6 cm of an object and a green LED to stay on in all other cases.

Key takeaways from this lab include learning how to set up an external sensor to interface with the Arduino, and how to use simple logic to make LEDs respond to data coming from the sensor.
